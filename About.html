              <p>Hi, Welcome to my website, My name is Chizoba Ndukwe, Iâ€™ve finished studying for a certification in
                Pearson BTEC National Diploma in information and technology at Nottingham college, and I'm currently
                studying for a degree in BSc Hons Software Engineering at Nottingham Trent University in Nottingham city,
                England, United Kingdom. I resumed my college education in September 2020 and ever since I have learned
                and adopted lots of skills in the field of computing and technology, from linear skills such as syste
                management and information to more complex activities such as learning and using programming languages to
                create software programs and website applications. I have fully mastered the skills of developing a front
                end website.<br>
                <b<br><br>                  
                  Company: University Park campus estate agents. 
                  Location: University Park campus, estate office. Nottingham city, England, United Kingdom. 
                  EMPLOYERS: Mr Wiggington and Mr Hugo. 
                  I had a work experience based on architecture at university park campus, Nottingham, England, United Kingdom.
                  My work experience took up to a Week to be completed. At the work experience, by using a computer aided
                  design (CAD) I helped to draw and design future buildings that are going to be built at the site. At my
                  work experience I learnt how to start and set up a foundation of a building, e.g. A task was given to
                  me, which was to figure out, how many rooms, will be in the building, the diverse ways of how to design
                  a room, corridor, a toilet etc. I learnt that the reason this is so important is to give the builders an
                  accurate structure of what they are expected to build.
